# Color Magnitude diagram or Hertz-Sprung Diagram
This is the simple process of Making a Color-Magnitude diagram also called the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram using Gaia datasets GaiaDR3. 
I used Scipy cubic spline to clean the outliers below the Main sequence turnoff. 
# CMD
The color-magnitude diagram is one of the important diagrams in astronomy and astrophysics. It is like a life chart of stars. The information about 
age, mass, Temperature, size, and density can be determined by CMD.
